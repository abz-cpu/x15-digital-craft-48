# L&D Energy — Floor Plan Studio · Project Plan

A cross-platform (web + iOS + Android), offline-first 2D/3D floor-plan drawing and property-data SaaS for UK estate agents, EPC (RdSAP) assessors, and interior designers — a modern, touch-first competitor to PlanUp and zPlan.

**Status:** Approved architecture & roadmap — implementation underway. The application lives in [`/studio`](../../studio/) in this repository (the GitHub integration could not create the planned dedicated repo; `studio/` is fully self-contained and extractable later). Phase 0 (monorepo scaffold, design tokens, CI), Phase 1 (properties dashboard with guest-mode local-first storage), and the Phase 2 editor slice (walls, rooms, snapping, undo/redo, GIA) are built and verified — see `studio/README.md`.

**Founding constraints:** solo founder building with AI tooling · all platforms launch together from one codebase · 3D is a post-MVP fast-follow · Guest Mode (no-account local use) is mandatory for App Store approval.

## Design Reference (v1 UI spec)

Three Claude Design screens, versioned in [`design/`](./design/) — open them in a browser to interact:

- **[`Dashboard.dc.html`](./design/Dashboard.dc.html) — My Properties**: top nav (Properties / Templates / Reports, New Property CTA, account menu with Agency team & Billing); property cards with live floor-plan SVG thumbnails; status workflow **Draft → Ready → Exported** with filter tabs + counts; search by address/postcode; grid/list toggle; per-property actions (Open in Editor, AI description, Export); empty state; toasts.
- **[`Editor.dc.html`](./design/Editor.dc.html) — Floor Plan Editor**: top bar (back, title + status pill, undo/redo, zoom %/fit, "Autosaved to Cloud", Export CTA); floating left tool palette **Select(V), Wall(W), Room(R), Door(D), Window(N), Stairs(S), Measure(M), Text(T)** with keyboard shortcuts and active-tool hint; dot/line grid; walls, double-line windows, doors with swing arcs, stairs, dimension lines; floor switcher (Ground/First/+), scale chip (1:50), snap indicator. Right panel, two tabs: **Properties** (room name, room-type select, width/length/area/wall-length readouts, ceiling height, per-room "include in GIA" checkbox — stairs excluded by default, GIA total footer) and **AI Assistant** (auto-name rooms from layout; generate listing/EPC description copy).
- **[`Export Modal.dc.html`](./design/Export%20Modal.dc.html)**: format (PDF vector / PNG 300 DPI), paper A4/A3, portrait/landscape, toggles for measurements and the RICS-style "not to scale" disclaimer, live sheet preview with branded header (address, floor, GIA, logo), file metadata, progress → success states.

**Design system to codify in `packages/ui`**: deep-green brand palette (`#0E3E36` brand, `#0B7A5E` primary action, `#F4F7F6` surface, status pill colours for Draft/Ready/Exported), Instrument Sans (UI) + IBM Plex Mono (measurements), 8–14px radii, pill badges, segmented controls.

**Deltas the plan resolves against the design**: the export modal shows PDF/PNG only — JPG and SVG (a core requirement) are added behind a "more formats" affordance; the design mocks rooms as rectangles — the real engine stays wall-graph-based with auto room detection, rendering to the same visual language; Templates and Reports nav items are post-MVP stubs.

## 1. Tech Stack

**One React + TypeScript codebase, packaged natively with Capacitor, backed by Supabase + PowerSync.**

| Layer | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Language | TypeScript everywhere | One language across editor, geometry engine, backend functions; best AI-tooling support; reuses existing React/TS skills |
| App framework | React 18 + Vite (PWA) | Already shipped on the agency site; fastest iteration loop |
| Mobile packaging | **Capacitor** (iOS + Android) | The app *is* a canvas editor — Canvas2D/WebGL runs GPU-composited at native speed inside WKWebView/Android WebView. One rendering target, one debugging surface |
| 2D canvas | **Konva (react-konva)** over a pure-TS core model | See §4 |
| 3D (fast-follow) | Three.js + react-three-fiber | Mature on web and inside Capacitor; reads the same document model |
| Backend | **Supabase** (Postgres, Auth, Storage, RLS, Edge Functions) | Managed Postgres with row-level security for multi-tenancy; `supabase-js` already familiar; generous free tier |
| Offline sync | **PowerSync** | Purpose-built offline-first layer for Postgres: on-device SQLite (native via Capacitor plugin; wa-sqlite/OPFS on web). App always reads/writes local; sync is background. Open-source & self-hostable → low vendor risk |
| UI kit | Tailwind + shadcn/ui (touch-sized variants) | Fast to build modern UI — themed to the L&D Energy design tokens |
| AI features | Claude API via Supabase Edge Functions | Powers the AI Assistant (auto-name rooms, listing/EPC description drafts). Server-side only — no API keys in the client; requires connectivity, so the UI degrades gracefully offline |
| Payments | Stripe (web checkout) | Purchases happen on the web under Apple's multiplatform-services rule (3.1.3(b)) to avoid the 30% IAP cut. **The mobile app must NOT be a hard login wall** — it ships with a functional Guest Mode (draw and export locally without an account); an empty login-shell app triggers automatic App Store rejection |
| Hosting | Cloudflare Pages (web app + marketing) | Existing deployment target |
| Monorepo | pnpm workspaces + Turborepo | Shares the core engine between web, mobile, and tests |

### Why not the alternatives

- **React Native / Expo**: RN's strengths (native scroll/navigation feel) barely matter for a canvas editor, while its weak leg — `react-native-web` — would degrade the desktop-web editor (keyboard shortcuts, context menus, precise mouse work). RN Skia on web ships a ~5 MB WASM runtime; Three.js on RN is painful. Two ecosystems to debug instead of one.
- **Flutter**: Best-in-class raw canvas, but Dart is a second language, its web builds are canvas-rendered blobs (slow first load, weak accessibility), the hiring pool is smaller, and AI-assisted development is markedly stronger in the TS ecosystem. Wrong trade for a solo founder.
- **Firebase instead of Supabase**: Firestore's offline cache is not a true sync engine (no relational queries, poor conflict control), NoSQL modelling fights the relational shape of orgs/properties/plans, and there's no RLS-grade multi-tenancy.

### Offline & conflict model

- Local-first **from day one** (retrofitting sync is the classic failure mode): every read/write hits on-device SQLite; PowerSync replicates to Postgres when online.
- Each floor's plan is a versioned JSON document (walls, openings, symbols, labels) + relational metadata (property, address, owner, org). Single-editor-per-plan is the real-world workflow, so **last-write-wins at document level + full revision history** (nothing is ever silently lost). The document model is designed so Yjs CRDTs can be layered on later for live collaboration.

### Data model sketch

```sql
-- Multi-tenancy (all tables RLS-scoped by org membership; PowerSync sync rules follow the same boundary)
orgs            (id, name, created_at)
org_members     (org_id, user_id, role)          -- owner | admin | member

-- Core domain
properties      (id, org_id, created_by, address_line1, address_line2, postcode,
                 status,                          -- draft | ready | exported
                 beds, property_meta, created_at, updated_at)
plans           (id, property_id, name, scale, unit_system, created_at, updated_at)
floors          (id, plan_id, name, sort_order, default_ceiling_height_m)

-- The drawing itself: LWW head + immutable history
floor_documents (floor_id PK, doc jsonb, version, updated_at, updated_by)
floor_revisions (id, floor_id, doc jsonb, version, created_at, created_by)

-- Commercial
subscriptions   (org_id, stripe_customer_id, plan_tier, status, current_period_end)
```

Guest Mode: rows are created in local SQLite with no `org_id`; signing up runs an **adoption migration** that assigns the user's new org to all local rows and lets PowerSync upload them. This flow is designed in from Phase 1, not retrofitted at store-submission time.

## 2. MVP Feature Roadmap (what converts a PlanUp/zPlan user)

**Editor (the product lives or dies here)**
- Wall drawing: tap/click-drag, orthogonal + angle snapping, grid snap, live dimension labels, **numeric length entry** (mm/cm/m/ft-in) to fix a wall's exact length
- Auto room detection from closed wall loops → auto-named rooms with live area
- Doors (with swing direction), windows, openings — attached to walls, slide along them
- Stairs + furniture/fixture symbol library (drag, drop, rotate, mirror)
- Multi-floor plans; text labels; unlimited undo/redo; pinch-zoom/pan; stylus (Apple Pencil) support
- **Photo underlay tracing**: photograph a hand sketch or old plan on-site and trace over it — a killer on-site workflow

**Measurements & EPC data (assessor lock-in)**
- Per-room area + perimeter; total floor area & Gross Internal Area (m²/ft²)
- **Heat-loss perimeter per storey**, room heights per floor/building part, extension zoning — the RdSAP inputs assessors currently compute by hand
- Room schedule / measurement table view; CSV export of all measurement data

**Output (agent/designer lock-in)**
- Client-side (works offline) export to **JPG, PNG, SVG, PDF** — vector PDF/300-DPI PNG per the export-modal design: A4/A3, portrait/landscape, measurements toggle, RICS-style disclaimer toggle, branded sheet header (address, floor, GIA, logo)

**AI Assistant (differentiator — neither PlanUp nor zPlan has this)**
- Auto-name rooms from the drawn layout; one-click **listing/EPC description drafts** from plan data (rooms, areas, floors) ready for Rightmove or the EPC report — per the editor's AI tab and dashboard AI action. Online-only, clearly badged, graceful offline fallback

**Platform**
- Full editor works offline on all three platforms; autosave; visible sync status; property/plan dashboard; shareable read-only plan links
- **Guest Mode / local-only free tier**: open the app and draw a plan immediately, no account required — plans persist on-device; signing up unlocks cloud sync, sharing, and branded exports. (Required for App Store approval, and doubles as the lowest-friction onboarding funnel)

**Explicitly post-MVP**: 3D view (fast-follow), CRM/EPC-software integrations (Alto, Reapit, Elmhurst), live collaboration, AI photo→plan.

## 3. Development Phases (solo founder + AI, ~20 weeks to closed beta)

- **Phase 0 — Foundations (wk 1)**: New repo, monorepo scaffold (`packages/core`, `packages/editor`, `packages/ui`, `apps/web`, `apps/mobile`, `supabase/`), CI, Supabase project, **design tokens codified from the L&D Energy draft** (palette, type, radii, pills, segmented controls).
- **Phase 1 — Auth, data & offline spine (wk 1–3)**: Supabase auth (email + Google + Apple), orgs/RLS, property & plan CRUD, **PowerSync local-first storage wired in from the start**, dashboard built to `Dashboard.dc.html` (status workflow Draft→Ready→Exported, filter tabs, search, grid/list, thumbnails from plan data), sync-status UI ("Autosaved to Cloud"). Design for **Guest Mode from the start**: the app is fully usable with no account (plans live in local SQLite only), and signing up adopts existing local plans into the synced account — this must be in the data model now, not retrofitted at store-submission time.
- **Phase 2 — 2D canvas engine core (wk 3–8)**: Pure-TS document model + geometry engine in `packages/core` (wall graph, snapping, shoelace area, room detection, command-pattern undo/redo — fully unit-tested, zero UI deps); Konva renderer; unified mouse/touch/stylus input layer; pan/zoom. Editor chrome per `Editor.dc.html`: floating tool palette with the design's keyboard shortcuts (V/W/R/D/N/S/M/T), active-tool hint, zoom controls, snap & scale chips, dot/line grid options.
  - **Geometry: build on proven libraries, don't hand-roll.** "Auto room detection from closed wall loops" is minimal-cycle finding in an imperfect planar graph — too math-heavy to write from scratch for an MVP. Evaluate and adopt existing computational-geometry libraries first: **JSTS** (JavaScript Topology Suite — its noding + `Polygonizer` does exactly this), **polygon-clipping** (Martinez boolean ops), **@flatten-js/core** (planar sets/faces), Clipper2. Our code owns the wall graph and snapping tolerances; the library owns polygonization and boolean ops.
  - **Input layer: aggressively disable native WebView gestures.** Strict requirement: `touch-action: none` on the canvas element, `overscroll-behavior: none` (no pull-to-refresh/rubber-banding), viewport `user-scalable=no` + iOS `gesturestart` prevention (no page pinch-zoom or double-tap zoom), `-webkit-user-select: none` / `-webkit-touch-callout: none` (no selection callouts), and swipe-back navigation disabled in Capacitor (`allowsBackForwardNavigationGestures = false` on WKWebView; handle Android back button explicitly). Otherwise the browser's native swipe-to-go-back and pinch-to-zoom fight the canvas controls — this must be in place before any gesture work, and verified on real iOS/Android devices.
- **Phase 3 — Architectural elements (wk 8–12)**: Doors (swing arcs) / windows (double-line) / openings, stairs, symbol library, dimension labels + numeric entry, multi-floor with the design's floor switcher, photo underlay. Right-hand Properties panel per the design: room name/type, dimension readouts, ceiling height, per-room GIA inclusion.
- **Phase 4 — Measurement & EPC engine (wk 12–14)**: GIA with per-room include/exclude (stairs out by default, live total in the panel footer), heat-loss perimeter, room heights, room schedule view, CSV export.
- **Phase 5 — Exports (wk 14–16)**: Export modal per `Export Modal.dc.html` — vector PDF (pdf-lib) and 300-DPI PNG first (A4/A3, orientation, measurements + disclaimer toggles, branded header, live preview), plus JPG and SVG (serialised from the document model) behind a "more formats" control — all client-side.
- **Phase 6 — Mobile packaging (wk 16–18)**: Capacitor iOS/Android builds, touch polish, WebView perf testing on mid-range Android, TestFlight + Play internal track. **Guest Mode is a store-submission blocker**: the app must be fully usable without an account (draw + local save + basic export), with sign-up as an upgrade path — a hard login wall on an app that sells outside IAP is an automatic Apple rejection.
- **Phase 7 — AI assistant, commercial layer & beta (wk 18–20)**: AI features from the design (auto-name rooms, listing/EPC description generation) via Claude API behind a Supabase Edge Function; Stripe billing; share links; onboarding; closed beta with 10–20 real assessors/agents.
- **Post-MVP**: 3D view (Three.js extrusion of the same model) → Templates & Reports sections from the dashboard nav → integrations → collaboration (Yjs).

---

## 4. Canvas / Graphics Approach

**Konva (react-konva) as the renderer, on top of a framework-agnostic pure-TypeScript document model.**

- The **document model and geometry engine live in `packages/core`** with zero rendering dependencies: wall graph, snapping, room detection (loop finding), area (shoelace), perimeters, serialisation, undo/redo commands. This is the company's real IP, it's fully unit-testable, and it makes the renderer swappable.
- **Konva** gives a retained-mode scene graph, built-in hit detection, dragging, transforms, layers, and `toDataURL` export — exactly the editor plumbing you'd otherwise hand-build — and renders to Canvas2D, which is GPU-composited and smooth in browsers and Capacitor WebViews alike.
- **Why not the others**: *Fabric.js* — aging imperative API, weak React/TS fit. *PixiJS* — WebGL speed you don't need (floor plans are hundreds of nodes, not 100k sprites) at the cost of building all editor tooling yourself; it remains the escape hatch if profiling ever demands it, swappable thanks to the core/renderer split. *Native SVG/DOM* — simplest, but pan/zoom and hit-testing degrade on large plans and touch gestures are all hand-rolled; SVG remains the **export** format, generated from the model, not the render layer.

---

## Key Risks & Mitigations

- **Canvas editor complexity underestimated** → build the core model test-first (Phase 2 gets the most calendar time); ship wall-drawing vertical slice early.
- **Sync conflicts corrupt plans** → LWW + immutable revision history; single-editor workflow assumption documented.
- **Apple App Store rejection** → Guest Mode makes the app functional standalone with no account (hard login walls that bypass IAP are auto-rejected); Apple sign-in offered alongside Google; no links to external purchase from within the iOS app.
- **Old-Android WebView performance** → test on a mid-range device from Phase 2, not Phase 6.
- **PowerSync dependency** → open-source and self-hostable; data access goes through a thin repository layer so the sync engine is replaceable.

---

## Next Steps

1. Initialize the new dedicated product repository with the Phase 0 monorepo scaffold.
2. Stand up the Supabase project + PowerSync instance (dev environment).
3. Begin Phase 1 with the dashboard and offline spine, using the design files in `design/` as the UI reference.
